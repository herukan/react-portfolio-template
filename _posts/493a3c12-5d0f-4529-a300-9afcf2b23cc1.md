# Project Overview

Developed an Android application to assess the risk of heart disease by analysing a user’s heartbeat sound. The app uses AI-powered machine learning models to process audio data captured via the smartphone's built-in microphone.

## Key Achievements

- Achieve the Finalist Spot in UAJY Siloam National Hackathon 2019 
- Led the team as Team Leader, managing the project from concept to deployment.
- Designed and developed the system architecture for the Android platform, ensuring smooth integration of machine learning models.
- Pre-processed heartbeat audio data, including tuning, normalization, and feature extraction, to improve the accuracy of the classification model.
- Developed a neural network for heartbeat classification, enabling practical and accessible heart disease risk assessment.
- Overcame challenges in capturing and preprocessing raw audio data using the smartphone's built-in microphone, ensuring reliable results.

### Technology Stack

- Frontend: Kotlin, Java (Android)
- Backend: SQLite
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow (Python)
